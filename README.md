This is a program that trains a neural network to classify data into two classes using two input features. Data points are taken from labeled CSV files with coordinates. The neural network is trained to find a straight line (linear boundary) that separates one cluster from another using the two features. This means that the model is deciding which side of the line any point is on. It uses a basic multilayer perceptron with a single layer of hidden units to do this. The training optimizes the weights of the model so that it can correctly predict the group of new, unseen data. This is an example of how to make, train, and test a neural network for basic linear classification using Deeplearning4j.
