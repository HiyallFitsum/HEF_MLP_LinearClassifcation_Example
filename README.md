This code is made to teach a neural network how to classify data into two groups using two input features. The data points come from CSV files with labels and their coordinates. The neural network learns to find a straight line (a linear boundary) that separates one group from the other based on these two features. This means the model figures out which side of the line each point belongs to. It uses a simple multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer to do this. The training adjusts the modelâ€™s weights so it can correctly predict the group for new, unseen data. This example shows how to build, train, and test a neural network for basic linear classification using Deeplearning4j.
